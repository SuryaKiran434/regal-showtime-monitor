# Regal Showtime Monitor

Monitors the Regal Cinemas website for a specific movie on a specific date and fires an email + desktop notification the moment showtimes go live. Once notified, it self-destructs the cron job — no manual cleanup needed.

Built for the use case where Regal publishes showtimes for future dates unpredictably, and you want to be first to know and book before seats fill up.

Every 30 minutes (cron)

  Daily heartbeat   Email alert sent
  email (1/day)     Desktop notification
  "still watching"  Cron job removed
                    Sentinel written (.notified)
```

**Key behaviours:**
- Only one instance runs at a time — a file lock prevents concurrent cron + manual runs
- A sentinel file (`.notified`) prevents duplicate emails even if cron is accidentally re-added
- A daily heartbeat email confirms the monitor is alive and shows what IS currently scheduled
- After a successful notification the cron job removes itself automatically
- The browser fallback reuses a persistent Chromium profile, so a Cloudflare clearance earned on one run is not thrown away on the next. **This speeds up the fallback only — it does not change how often the fast path succeeds.** See [Architecture Notes](#architecture-notes).
- Fetching is retried up to 3 times per run with a 5-second delay between attempts

## File Structure

```
movie-automation/
├── monitor.py        Main monitoring script (run via run_now.sh from cron)
├── lock.py           Process lock — prevents concurrent runs
├── run_now.sh        Control panel: resolves Python, runs on demand, manages cron
├── tests/            pytest suite (fully mocked — no network, no browser)
├── requirements.txt  Python dependencies
├── .env.example      Template for .env — placeholders only, safe to commit
├── .env              Your credentials and config (gitignored, never committed)
├── sonar-project.properties  SonarCloud scan configuration, used by CI
├── .github/          CI, Slack notify and Dependabot auto-merge workflows
├── LICENSE
└── .gitignore
```

Runtime files created automatically (gitignored):
```
monitor.log           Audit log
.notified             Sentinel — written after email is sent
.last_heartbeat       Tracks when last daily heartbeat was sent
.monitor.lock         Process lock file
.browser-profile/     Chromium user-data dir for the fallback (cookies/cache)
```

`.browser-profile/` holds only regmovies.com browsing state. No login happens
anywhere in this flow, so no credentials land there — but it is gitignored
regardless, and a test asserts that it stays that way.

## Prerequisites

- macOS (uses `osascript` for desktop notifications and `crontab` for scheduling)
- **Python 3.12+** — via [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or a system install. CI runs 3.12.
- A Gmail account with 2-Step Verification enabled

`run_now.sh` resolves the Python interpreter **at run time** — nothing is
hard-coded, so it works on a fresh clone and survives a Python upgrade. It picks
the first of:

1. `$MOVIE_MONITOR_PYTHON`, if you set it — an explicit override that wins over
   everything else
2. `$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/python` — the venv you have activated
3. `./venv/bin/python` or `./.venv/bin/python` next to the script — the venv the
   setup below creates
4. `python3` from `$PATH`

If none of those turns up a usable interpreter it exits non-zero and prints
what it looked at and how to fix it, rather than failing silently. Check what
it would use:

```bash
./run_now.sh --print-python
```

> **Under cron**, `$PATH` is minimal (usually `/usr/bin:/bin`) and your shell
> profile is not sourced, so a pyenv shim will not be found. Options 3 and 4 are
> what cron relies on — the repo-local `./venv` (absolute, PATH-independent) is
> the most reliable, or set `MOVIE_MONITOR_PYTHON` in the crontab itself.

---

## One-Time Setup

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuryaKiran434/movie-automation.git
cd movie-automation
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Chromium binary (~400MB) for the browser fallback.
# Needed for real runs. NOT needed to run the tests — see "Running the tests".
playwright install chromium
```

### 3. Create your `.env` file

Copy the template and fill in your own values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

[`.env.example`](.env.example) carries placeholders only and is safe to commit.
`.env` is gitignored and must never be:

```
SENDER_EMAIL=you@gmail.com
SENDER_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
RECIPIENT_EMAIL=you@gmail.com
MOVIE_TITLE=dhurandhar
TARGET_DATE=03-27-2026
TEST_RECIPIENT_EMAIL=
```

All five of the first variables are required; `monitor.py` refuses to start and
names the missing ones if any is blank.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SENDER_EMAIL` | Gmail address the alert is sent **from** |
| `SENDER_APP_PASSWORD` | 16-character Gmail App Password (see below) |
| `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` | Address the alert is delivered **to** (can be the same as sender) |
| `MOVIE_TITLE` | Keyword to match — case-insensitive substring of the film title |
| `TARGET_DATE` | Date you want to see the movie — format `MM-DD-YYYY` |
| `TEST_RECIPIENT_EMAIL` | Optional override recipient for manual test runs |

### 4. Generate a Gmail App Password

1. Go to [myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Enable **2-Step Verification** if not already on (required)
3. Search for **App passwords** and open it
4. Create a new app password — name it anything (e.g. "Movie Monitor")
5. Copy the 16-character code (spaces included) and paste it as `SENDER_APP_PASSWORD`

> Your normal Gmail login password will **not** work here. Only App Passwords work with SMTP.

### 5. About `MOVIE_TITLE` matching

The keyword is matched as a **case-insensitive substring** against the exact title Regal returns from their API.

```
API title: "Dhurandhar The Revenge (Hindi)"

MOVIE_TITLE=dhurandhar          ✅  matches
MOVIE_TITLE=The Revenge         ✅  matches
MOVIE_TITLE=HINDI               ✅  matches (it's inside the title)
MOVIE_TITLE=dhurandhar hindi    ❌  not a contiguous substring
MOVIE_TITLE=reveng              ❌  incomplete word, no match
```

**Recommendation:** Use the most distinctive single word from the title.

---

## Usage

All operations go through `run_now.sh`. Run it with no arguments for an interactive menu, or pass a flag:

```bash
./run_now.sh               # Interactive menu
./run_now.sh --run         # Trigger a check right now
./run_now.sh --status      # Show last 20 lines of monitor.log + cron status
./run_now.sh --cron-on     # Install cron job (runs every 30 minutes)
./run_now.sh --cron-off    # Remove cron job
./run_now.sh --cron-status # Check whether cron is active
```

Diagnostics:

```bash
./run_now.sh --print-python      # Show which interpreter would be used
./run_now.sh --print-cron-entry  # Show the crontab line --cron-on would install
./run_now.sh --cron-run          # What the cron entry itself invokes
```

`--cron-on` rewrites your user crontab: it strips any existing line for this
job (so re-running never duplicates it), then appends

```
*/30 * * * * "/path/to/run_now.sh" --cron-run >> "/path/to/monitor.log" 2>&1 # movie-monitor
```

The entry calls **`run_now.sh`, not an interpreter path** — so the interpreter is
resolved every time the job fires and the entry does not go stale when Python
moves. stderr goes to the log rather than `/dev/null`, so a resolution failure
shows up in `--status` instead of vanishing.

`--cron-off` removes it again, matching either the `# movie-monitor` marker or
the older `monitor.py` form, so an entry installed by a previous version of this
script is cleaned up (and `--cron-on` migrates it in place). Unrelated crontab
lines are left alone. No `sudo`, no LaunchAgent — a plain user crontab entry you
can inspect with `crontab -l`.

### Typical workflow

```bash
# 1. Fill in .env with your credentials and target movie/date

# 2. Run once manually to verify everything works end-to-end
./run_now.sh --run

# 3. Start the automated monitor
./run_now.sh --cron-on

# 4. Check status at any time
./run_now.sh --status
```

When the movie is found:
1. Email alert delivered to `RECIPIENT_EMAIL`
2. macOS desktop notification pops up immediately
3. Cron job removed automatically — no manual cleanup needed

---

## Running the tests

```bash
pip install pytest
python -m pytest
```

**22 tests**, all of them fully mocked. The parsing tests run against an in-file
`getShowtimes` fixture — the exact payload shape Regal returns — so nothing
touches the network, and the browser path is stubbed rather than driven. The
`run_now.sh` tests shell out to the script with controlled environments and
stub interpreters; they never read or write the real crontab.

That means **`playwright install chromium` is not required to run the tests.**
CI installs the `playwright` package (it is imported at module scope in
`monitor.py`) but deliberately skips the ~400MB browser download.

Coverage:

| Area | Tests |
|---|---|
| `find_movie` | case-insensitive substring match, absent title, empty payload |
| Parsing | `_film_titles`, `_parse_language`, `_format_time`, `_experience_label` |
| Email | `build_email` renders grouped, sorted showtimes |
| Fetch strategy | direct path preferred; browser fallback used when direct returns `None` |
| Browser profile | profile dir location and name, persistent context is used, graceful fallback when the profile dir is unusable, and that the dir is gitignored |
| Interpreter resolution | all four branches in priority order (`$MOVIE_MONITOR_PYTHON`, activated venv, repo-local `venv`/`.venv`, `python3` on PATH), loud non-zero failure for an unusable override and for no interpreter at all, and that the cron entry embeds no interpreter path |

CI runs on every push to `main` and every pull request. The **`Tests (Python)`**
check is a required status check on `main`. The same job measures coverage
(`--cov=monitor --cov=lock`), uploads `coverage.xml` as a build artifact, and
runs an advisory **SonarCloud** scan configured by `sonar-project.properties`;
`continue-on-error` keeps a Sonar outage from failing the required check.

`.github/dependabot.yml` opens **one grouped pull request per ecosystem per
week** (`pip` and `github-actions`), collapsing that week's patch and minor
bumps into a single PR. `.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml` then
enables auto-merge on those PRs, so they merge themselves once the required
checks pass. Majors are kept out of the groups and wait for a human.

## Monitoring Lifecycle

```
You run:  ./run_now.sh --cron-on
              └── cron fires every 30 min
              └── each run logs one line: "Not listed yet — N films on schedule"

Regal publishes showtimes for your target date
              └── next cron run detects it
              └── email + desktop notification sent
              └── cron removes itself
              └── .notified file written (stores movie + date, blocks duplicates)
              └── done — no further action needed

If TARGET_DATE passes without the movie being found:
              └── next cron run after the date detects expiry
              └── "not found" summary email sent
              └── cron removes itself
              └── .notified written (prevents resend)
```

### Daily heartbeat email

Once per day while the movie hasn't been found yet, the monitor sends a brief plain-text email:

```
Daily check-in — Mar 20, 2026
────────────────────────────────────────
Watching  : dhurandhar
Theater   : Regal Medlock Crossing
Target    : Friday, March 27, 2026

Status    : API reachable — 12 film(s) scheduled, target not listed yet.

Films currently on schedule for that date:
  • Some Movie Title
  • Another Movie
  ...
```

This is your safety net. If heartbeats stop arriving, something broke and you should check the log.

---

## Changing the Movie or Date

Edit `.env` and update `MOVIE_TITLE` and/or `TARGET_DATE`. Then reset state and restart:

```bash
rm -f .notified .last_heartbeat
./run_now.sh --cron-on
```

No code changes needed.

---

## Log Format

Each run adds one line to `monitor.log`. Example over several days:

```
2026-03-20 00:30  [INFO]     Not listed yet — 12 film(s) on schedule, keyword 'dhurandhar' not among them.
2026-03-20 01:00  [INFO]     Not listed yet — 12 film(s) on schedule, keyword 'dhurandhar' not among them.
...
2026-03-20 12:00  [INFO]     Daily heartbeat sent.
...
2026-03-26 14:00  [INFO]     FOUND: 'Dhurandhar The Revenge (Hindi)'
2026-03-26 14:00  [INFO]     Email delivered to you@gmail.com
2026-03-26 14:00  [INFO]     Desktop notification sent.
2026-03-26 14:00  [INFO]     Cron job removed — no further scheduled checks.
2026-03-26 14:00  [INFO]     Done — email sent, desktop notified, cron removed.
```

## Troubleshooting

**".env file not found"**
The `.env` file must exist in the project root. Create it with the five required variables listed in the setup section.

**"Missing required .env variable(s)"**
All five variables in `.env` must have values. Check for typos or blank lines.

**"Gmail authentication failed"**
- You must use an App Password, not your regular Gmail password
- 2-Step Verification must be enabled first
- Generate a new App Password at [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)

**"getShowtimes API did not fire"**
Regal hasn't published a schedule for your target date yet. Normal — the monitor will keep checking every 30 minutes.

**"Fetch failed after 3 attempts"**
A transient network or Cloudflare issue. The cron will retry automatically in 30 minutes. If it persists, run `./run_now.sh --run` to see the live error.

**Heartbeat emails stopped arriving**
```bash
./run_now.sh --cron-status   # is cron still installed?
./run_now.sh --run           # run manually and watch output
./run_now.sh --status        # check the log
```

**Email not received after `.notified` exists**
The notification already fired. To resend manually:
```bash
rm .notified && ./run_now.sh --run
```

**"TARGET_DATE has already passed and the monitor has never run"**
You set a past date in `.env` before the monitor ever ran. Update `TARGET_DATE` to a future date.

**"not found" summary email received**
The target date passed without the movie being listed. To watch for a new movie or date:
```bash
# Update MOVIE_TITLE and TARGET_DATE in .env, then:
rm -f .notified .last_heartbeat
./run_now.sh --cron-on
```

**"Persistent browser profile ... unusable — using a throwaway profile"**
The monitor still ran; only the Cloudflare-clearance reuse was lost for that
run. Usually a stale Chromium lock left behind by a killed process. Delete the
profile and let it rebuild:
```bash
rm -rf .browser-profile && ./run_now.sh --run
```

**".notified exists for different movie/date" warning in log**
`.env` was changed after a previous notification. Delete `.notified` to start fresh:
```bash
rm .notified && ./run_now.sh --cron-on
```

---

## Architecture Notes

**Two-path fetch strategy:** `fetch_showtimes()` tries `_fetch_direct()` first — a plain `httpx` HTTP/2 GET straight at `getShowtimes` with browser-ish headers, ~1s when it works. If it returns anything other than a 200, or raises, the function falls through to `_fetch_via_browser()`. There is no shared state between the two; the fast path is simply attempted first every run.

**Cloudflare bypass:** Direct HTTPS calls to the Regal API frequently return 403. Playwright launches a real Chromium browser which passes Cloudflare's bot detection. The browser navigates to `THEATER_URL?date=MM-DD-YYYY`, the Regal React app reads the date parameter and calls the `getShowtimes` API client-side, and Playwright intercepts that response via `page.expect_response()`.

**Persistent browser profile:** `_open_browser_context()` uses `launch_persistent_context()` against a gitignored `.browser-profile/` directory rather than a fresh throwaway context. Chromium keeps its cookies there, including Cloudflare's `cf_clearance`, so a clearance earned on one fallback is still valid on the next one and the challenge is skipped instead of re-solved. Only one monitor runs at a time (see the process lock), so the profile is never contended. If the directory turns out to be unusable — a stale Chromium lock, wrong permissions — the code logs a warning and falls back to a throwaway `launch()` + `new_context()` for that run, so an unusable profile degrades performance rather than breaking the monitor.

> **What the profile does *not* do:** it does not improve the fast path's hit rate. `_fetch_direct()` builds its own `httpx.Client`, which has a **separate cookie jar** and never sees the browser profile. A `cf_clearance` cookie sitting in `.browser-profile/` is invisible to it. The persistent profile makes the **browser fallback** cheaper; the direct HTTPS call succeeds or fails exactly as often as it did before.

**Event-driven response capture:** `page.expect_response()` wraps the `page.goto()` call — the script receives the data the instant the API responds, rather than sleeping for a fixed duration.

**Process safety:** `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` on a shared lock file prevents concurrent runs from cron and manual triggers interfering with each other.

**Duplicate prevention:** A `.notified` sentinel file is written after successful delivery and checked at startup. If present, the script exits in under a second — no browser launched. The sentinel stores `movie=`, `date=`, and `notified_at=` so the script can detect when `.env` has been changed to a new movie/date and warn you rather than silently exiting.

**Past-date handling:** If `TARGET_DATE` has already passed when the script runs, the outcome depends on history. If neither `.notified` nor `.last_heartbeat` exists (monitor never ran), it exits with an error so you know to fix the config. If either file exists (monitor ran but movie was never found), it sends a one-time "not found" summary email and removes the cron job.
